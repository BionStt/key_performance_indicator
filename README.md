<h2><a name="introduction">What is a KPI?</a></h2>

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a type of performance measurement.

* A KPI evaluates the success of an organization or activity.
* Choosing the right KPIs needs good understanding of what is important to the or

Success examples:

* Repeated periodic achievement of an operational goal, such as 100% customer satistfaction, or zero defects, etc.
* Making progress toward strategic goals.

<h2><a name="how-to-define-a-kpi">How to define a KPI</a></h2>

To define a KPI, you can cover these areas:

* Title: use an exact name to avoid ambiguity
* Objective: the relation of the indicator with the organizational objectives must be clear
* Scope: state the areas of business and/or parts of the organization that are included and/or excluded.
* Target: Benchmarks must be determined in order to monitor progress
* Formula: the exact calculation of the indicator
* Units: what is/are the unit(s) of measurement in use
* Frequency: when is the indicator recorded and reported
* Data source: the exact data sources involved in calculating a indicator value
* Owner: the accountable person for the indicator
* Comments: any outstanding issues regarding the indicator


<h2><a name="how-to-improve-a-kpi">How to improve a KPI</a></h2>

To improve a KPI, you can ask these questions:

* Does it clearly define what constitutes success?
* Does it clearly relate to a strategic objective and key result (OKR)?
* Does it provide the information required to set SMART goals?
* Does it accurately portray progress and probability of achieving both long-term strategic objectives and near-term milestones?
* Does it identify the root causes of barriers?
* Does it focus the organization on the priority improvement needs?
* Does it drive the behavior and actions required to achieve the objectives?
* Does it align work with value?


<h2><a name="indicators">Indicators</a></h2>

* Quantitative indicators: can be presented with a number.
* Qualitative indicators: can't be presented as a number.
* Leading indicators: predict the outcome of a process
* Lagging indicators: present the success or failure post hoc
* Input indicators: measure the amount of resources consumed during the generation of the outcome
* Process indicators: represent the efficiency or the productivity of the process
* Output indicators: reflect the outcome or results of the process activities
* Practical indicators: interface with existing company processes.
* Directional indicators: specifying how something is changing, such as getting better or worse.
* Actionable indicators: sufficiently in an organization's control to effect change.
* Financial indicators: used in performance measurement and when looking at an operating index.


<h2><a name="kpi-vs-kli-vs-kpm">KPI vs. KLI vs. KPM</a></h2>

* A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is the top-level concept in this guide.

* A Key Leading Indicator (KLI) is a KPI that tends to show up earliest.

* A Key Performance Measure (KPM) is how you measure a KPI.


<h2><a name="meeasure-vs-metric">Measure vs. metric</a></h2>

There is overlap between a measure and a metric.

* A measures are concrete, usually measure one thing, and are quantitative in nature (e.g. I have five apples).

* A metric describe a quality and require a measurement baseline (I have five more apples than I did yesterday).

Examples:

* A measure can be useful for demonstrating workloads and activity

* A metric can be useful for evaluating compliance, processes effectiveness, and measuring success against established objectives.
